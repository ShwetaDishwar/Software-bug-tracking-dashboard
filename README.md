Software Bug Tracking Dashboard
This project involves building a Software Development & Bug Tracking Dashboard using synthetic data. The dashboard provides insights into sprint progress, backlog status, issue resolution, and workload distribution to improve project management and bug tracking efficiency.

Project Overview
- Dataset: Synthetic bug tracking data containing multiple sprints, issues, developer roles, and resolution times.
- Goal: Track sprint progress, backlog, issue resolution time, and workload distribution for better project management.

Key Insights
- Sprint Progress: Visualized the status of all sprints, including completion rates and delays.
- Bug Resolution Time: Analyzed average resolution time to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
- Workload Distribution: Tracked workload distribution across different developer roles and teams.
- Priority Breakdown: Displayed the number of high, medium, and low-priority bugs to improve task management.
- Backlog Summary: Identified backlog accumulation and resolution rates.
- Issue Reopen Rate: Analyzed the percentage of issues that were reopened after resolution.
- First Response Time: Measured how quickly issues were addressed after being reported.

Future Enhancements
- Adding more granular metrics for developer performance analysis.
- Automating backlog tracking for real-time insights.
- Enhancing visual elements for better user experience.

Skills Used
- Excel, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Dashboard Design, Project Management
